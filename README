The following modules are written in python 2.7. They require the module
pybloomfiltermmap which can be installed using
	$ sudo pip install pybloomfiltermmap
or built from source at https://github.com/axiak/pybloomfiltermmap/
Pybloomfiltermmap documentation: http://axiak.github.io/pybloomfiltermmap/#

kmer_bloom.py: Takes a .fa file on standard input and loads it into a bloom
	filter using a user defined k-mer length and false positive ratio which
	are both command line arguments.

	USAGE: $ python2 kmer_bloom.py 20 .01 < example.fa
        where 20 is the kmer length, .01 is the error rate, and
        example.fa is a .fa file.

query_bloom.py: Takes a .fastq file on standard input and searches for the
	reads within a bloom filter that is passed as a command line
	argument along with a k-mer length.
	
	USAGE: $ python2 query_bloom.py example.bloom 20 < reads.fastq
        where example.bloom is the already built bloom filter,
        20 is the kmer length, and reads.fastq is a .fastq file.
